### Description:
!(*All students must comply with these criteria. If the student does not comply with these criteria, the score will be lowered.*)!
### In this work, these following criteria had to be done:
* Create an additional class for testing K (example: MyHashTable<MyTestingClass, Student> table = new MyHashTable<>();)

* Create your own hashCode() method in MyTestingClass (You are not allowed to use default hashing methods like Objects.hash())

* Add random 10000 elements to your hashtable and print number of elements in each bucket (chain or linkedlist).

* Tune your hashCode method in MyTestingClass so that it does not violate the uniform distribution.
### MyHashTable:
#### *Explanation:*
#### *Here is the solution code*:
